ActsAsFu
========

We’ve all seen the job listings. We know what they’re looking for. Rockstars. Code Monkeys. Rails Ninjas.

And you’re left thinking, “But I’m just a programmer.” Well, not anymore. Today, you become a Rails Kung-Fu Master!

“Not me,” you say. “I’ve already tried using all the acts_as_something plugins and all the something_fu plugins; and I’m still not a Rockstar or a Ninja. I’m barely a Code Simian!”

Sounds like you’ve tried the rest – now try the best! That’s right: it’s the new and improved ActsAsFu Rails plugin!

Three Easy Steps to Becoming a Rails Kung-Fu Master:

1. Stop web server

mongrel_rails stop

2. Install Plugin

script/plugin install git://github.com/jlapier/acts_as_fu.git

3. Start web server

mongrel_rails start

(note: if you’re using mongrel_cluster, thin, piston, or anything like that, these instructions don’t apply to you – you figure it out yourself, you Rockstar Ninja!)

Now you’re on your way to programming stardom! Catch ya on fame’s backside, my friend!
